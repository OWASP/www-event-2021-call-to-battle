pitch: "Calling all hackers, gaming-nerds, social-bandwagoners, and connectors of fun we have an offering just for you. 

<br><br>Call To Battle events are a gateway to connecting with others around the world to play DD, fight for a top spot in Capture the Flag, take-on Bug Bounties, build virtual worlds, and more. 

<br><br>Organizers will self-manage and create access for the community to join in the challenge, game, or social activity they have developed."

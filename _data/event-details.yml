pitch: "Calling all hackers, gaming-nerds, social-bandwagoners, and connectors of fun we have an offering just for you. Weâ€™ll be calling on our OWASP community to submit ideas for this anything-goes format event, that is all about sharing what you find thrilling and want to share with others. Think of this as a gateway to connecting with others around the world to play DD, fight for a top spot in Capture the Flag, take-on Bug Bounties, build virtual worlds, and more. For selected submissions, organizers will self-manage and create access for the community to join in the challenge, game, or social activity they have developed.
       Watch for our Open Call in January 2021."
